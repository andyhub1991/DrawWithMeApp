# DrawWithMe - AI-Powered Drawing App for Toddlers

An interactive step-by-step drawing app that teaches young children (ages 1-3) how to draw through AI-enhanced guidance and pixel-art style graphics.

## 🤖 AI-First Design

**DrawWithMe** leverages AI to create an adaptive, personalized drawing experience:

- **Smart Animal Recognition** - AI understands what children want to draw, even from partial or misspelled inputs
- **Intelligent Suggestions** - Machine learning recommends animals based on skill level and drawing history
- **Adaptive Difficulty** - AI adjusts complexity based on child's progress and motor skill development

## 🎯 Core Features

- **Step-by-step guidance** with encouraging, age-appropriate language
- **Simple geometric shapes** that combine into recognizable animals
- **24+ animals** from easy (cat, dog) to advanced (elephant, whale)
- **Celebration animations** that reward completion
- **Zero pressure** - self-paced, no timers, just fun

## 🚀 Future Vision: On-Device AI

We're building towards a future where **on-device AI** transforms every child's drawing experience:

### Near-term Goals
- **Voice Input** - "I want to draw a unicorn!" → AI generates custom step-by-step instructions
- **Drawing Recognition** - AI validates each step and provides gentle corrections
- **Personalized Learning Paths** - Adapt to each child's unique pace and abilities

### Long-term Vision
- **Infinite Content** - On-device AI generates new animals, objects, and scenes on demand
- **Creative Mode** - Children describe their imagination, AI helps them draw it
- **Multi-modal Input** - Combine voice, touch, and even camera input for AR drawing
- **Offline-First** - All AI features work without internet, respecting privacy

## 🤝 Open Source Collaboration
