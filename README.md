# DrawWithMe - Interactive Drawing App for Toddlers

A step-by-step guided drawing app that teaches young children (ages 1-3) how to draw animals through simple, encouraging instructions and pixel-art style graphics.

## 🎯 Vision & Purpose

**DrawWithMe** transforms the intimidating task of "drawing" into a fun, confidence-building activity for toddlers. Instead of facing a blank canvas, children follow gentle step-by-step guidance to create recognizable animals using simple shapes like circles, triangles, and lines.

### Core Philosophy
- **Every step builds success** - Children see progress immediately
- **Simple shapes, big results** - Complex animals built from basic geometric forms
- **Encouraging language** - Instructions that make children feel capable and excited
- **Self-paced learning** - No timers, no pressure, just fun

## 🎯 Target Audience

**Primary users:** Children aged 1-3 who are developing fine motor skills and beginning to explore creative expression.

**Secondary users:** Parents and caregivers seeking engaging, educational screen time that builds confidence and artistic skills.
